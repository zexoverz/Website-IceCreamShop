      <div class="menu 1">Gelato
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/10/2048x1367/gallery-1489169161-gettyimages-593453987.jpg?resize=980:*" style= "width: 200px; height: 200px;";>
      <p style="font-size: 15px">Italian gelato ripples and forms imperfect scoops because it is so much denser than standard American ice cream. That's because it contains a higher volume of milk than cream, and it's churned at a slower rate, which means less air is incorporated. There also tends to be no (or very little) egg involved, so that the flavor is more intense and pure.</p>

      <div class="menu 2">Italian Ice
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/10/1489169775-ice.jpg?crop=1xw:1.0xh;center,top&resize=980:*" style= "width: 200px; height: 200px;">
        <p style="font-size: 15px">Often confused with American sherbet, Italian ice — AKA "water ice" — is fruit-based and made by the same process as standard ice cream (freezing the ingredients while mixing them). It contains no dairy, though sometimes egg white is included. Because of this, it's got an almost velvety-smooth texture and typical flavors include lemon, cherry, blue raspberry, and watermelon.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="menu 3">Sorbet
        <img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/10/1600x1291/gallery-1489169403-gettyimages-86287605.jpg?resize=980:*" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">There's no dairy in this fruit-forward frozen treat, making it denser and much richer in taste than traditional ice cream. Sometimes there's even alcohol in the recipe to lower the freezing temperature and create its popular, soft-yet-icy texture. While it's become popular in the U.S., it's been around in the U.K., France, and Australia for even longer.</p>
